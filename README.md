# APlanForEating

## Introduction

This is a series of rules, sample menus, and shopping lists designed for weight loss.

This is designed for [me](http://schof.org/about-john-mark-schofield). It's not a general-purpose diet, it's a **me** diet. If it works for you, great. If not, you can use it as a starting point and make it fit your particular biology and needs and food preferences.

I welcome corrections, suggestions, footnotes, and pull requests.


## Weight Loss

This is my **current** eating plan. It is designed for weight loss. It is not a long-term plan for healthy eating.

In general, we're looking at a low fat, high protein diet with lots of fruit and vegetables.

There is no calorie counting. I'm limiting the food types I'm eating, but not the amounts. I eat until I feel full. I do try to eat less of the "Moderation" foods and even less of the "Very Little" foods.
